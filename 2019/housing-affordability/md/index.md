## Housing (un)affordability

`2019-02`

There are increasing concerns regarding housing affordability in Canada, as well as in other parts of the world. Today I argue that there should be tighter  regulations regarding sufficient standards of housing (i.e. ensuring for minimum levels for those of low socio-economic status), while at the same time, those in higher income brackets should have lower expectations in terms of their own housing demands.

Historically, housing affordability has typically been measured via whether a household is spending above a certain percentage (or ratio) of its income on housing. 30% is often the ratio used in Canada (e.g. Rea et al., 2008). This ratio is included in national surveys like the Canadian census. However, several researchers have argued that using a simple ratio to define housing affordability is problematic given its insensitivity to households of varying incomes, demographic structure, preferences, and geographies. A number of researchers (e.g. Hulchanski, 1995) that this ratio is suitable for basic descriptive analysis, but it is not suitable for public policy on defining housing need and distributing services. A paper by Hancock (1993) attempts to improve upon definitions of housing affordability by defining minimum socially acceptable standards of consumption of housing and non-housing goods from basic economic principles.

This is exemplified in the figure below where %%H%% is housing consumption, %%Y%% is consumption of non-housing goods, and %%H^x %% and %%Y^x%% are their respective minimum sufficiency standards.
Theoretically, all households can be placed somewhere on this plot. At a simple level, housing is affordable to those, %%i%%, who have an income, %%I%%, that is greater than the line %%E^x%% as they can afford sufficient standards of housing without compromising the ability to access and consume adequate levels of all other non-housing goods (e.g. food, healthcare, education, daily travel, etc.). In a quixotic world, all households would be living in situations such that %%H_i > H^x%% and %%Y_i > Y^x%%.

The description provided by Hancock (1993) is a good conceptual starting point, but defining minimum sufficiency standards for housing is incredibly difficult and certainly more complex than a two-dimensional plot. Doing so requires a combination of technical knowledge (e.g. building engineering) and societal input (i.e. through democratic governance). I propose that sufficient standards for housing, %%H^x%%, can be subdivided into three categories 1) engineering standards (e.g. structural stability, fire resistance, heating and cooling, proper ventilation) 2) architectural standards (e.g. adequate living space, kitchen, bathrooms, etc. for each person in the household), and 3) geographic context (e.g. in a location where the household has the means to access necessary out of home activities like employment, shopping, education, etc.). Standards will certainly vary by household type, needs and ability, as well as regionally depending on climate and cultural differences. Moreover, there are also a myriad of dimensions in %%Y%% which would also have a variety of sufficiency standards (e.g. healthcare, daily travel, education, food, etc.), and many of the components in %%H%% and %%Y%% are endogenous and inter-connected (e.g. increasing one component can help in another domain).

It is the duty of well-functioning democratic governments to define and enforce minimum standards, not just for housing, but other necessities as well (e.g. health care, education, etc.). It is not a question of whether there should be less regulations, as some economists suggest, but more a question how they should be designed in order to uphold socially acceptable sufficiency standards (e.g. how do we make sure that all households have %%H^x%% and %%Y^x%%). In the Toronto region, this is being achieved in some domains (e.g. potable water is provided to nearly all dwellings), but less so in other domains (e.g. many suburban areas do not have adequate public transit service).

The majority of households in Canada live in excess, and do not need government assistance when it comes to housing. They consume much more housing and non-housing goods than minimum standards (i.e. their income is such that %%I_i >> Y^x + H^x%%, %%Y_i >> Y^x%%, and %%H_i >> H^x%%). In terms housing in Toronto, many people have more physical space than what they need, individual dwellings occupy more land than necessary, arguably contributing to concerns like suburban sprawl and auto oriented travel. As well, the vast majority of households have expectations for themselves that are much greater than what the socially minimum standard for society should be, both in terms of %%Y%% and %%H%%. Understandably, most people want more than the minimum, to varying degrees and personal preferences. But as demand for housing increases relative to supply (e.g. when costs for housing go up, as they are in the current economic climate), it means that some households may not have the income to afford housing that meets their high expectations, or they have less than expected to spend on other non-housing goods. However, despite having less than they desire, many of these households are not at risk of going below the minimum standards %%H^x%% and %%Y^x%%. Now I believe there are legit concerns regarding income inequality and foreign investment driving up demand and prices, as well as zoning constraints and other poor regulations that are limiting supply, all of which are worthy of further discussion. But wealthier households should lower their high expectations for housing as well as other goods as their desire for excess consumption drives up costs for all. As well, we as a society should not lower %%H^x%% and %%Y^x%%, the set of minimum socially acceptable standards, just because costs of housing have increased overall.
